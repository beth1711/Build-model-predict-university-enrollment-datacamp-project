# Build-model-predict-university-enrollment-datacamp-project
This is a Datacamp project using Regression model in order to predict the course enrollment in the future.

The project has 10 tasks that need to solve:
Tasks

1. For every column in the data:
a. State whether the values match the description given in the table above.
b. State the number of missing values in the column.
c. Describe what you did to make values match the description if they did not
match.
2. Describe the distribution of the enrollment counts. Your answer must include a
visualization that shows the distribution.
3. Create a visualization that shows how many courses were of each type. Use the
visualization to:
a. State which type of course has the most observations
b. Explain whether the observations are balanced across the types.
4. Describe the relationship between course type and the enrollment count. Your answer
must include a visualization to demonstrate the relationship.
5. The university wants to predict how many students will enroll in a course. State the
type of machine learning problem that this is (regression/ classification/ clustering).
6. Fit a baseline model to predict how many students will enroll using the data provided.
You must include your code.
7. Fit a comparison model to predict how many students will enroll using the data
provided. You must include your code.
8. Explain why you chose the two models used in parts 6 and 7.
9. Compare the performance of the two models used in parts 6 and 7, using any method
suitable. You must include your code.
10. Explain which model performs better and why.
